**Learning AWT Repository**
This repository contains three simple Java applications developed using AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) for graphical user interfaces.

**GridGame**

The GridGame is a simple game where players take turns clicking on empty buttons. Each button is colored in the player's color (red or blue) upon clicking. The objective is to create the most continuous structure of four or more buttons in a horizontal or vertical direction. Diagonals don't count. Enjoy the game and see who can create the longest structure!

**Calculator**

The Calculator is a basic arithmetic calculator that allows users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also includes decimal and equal buttons for precision calculations. The calculator's user interface is designed using AWT, making it simple and easy to use.

**Joke Generator**

The Joke Generator is a fun application that generates random jokes to bring a smile to your face. When you click the "Let's Laugh!" button, a random joke will be displayed in the text area. The Joke Generator utilizes AWT for the graphical user interface and contains a collection of hilarious jokes to brighten your day.

**How to Use**

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the individual Java files using a Java development environment (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc.).
3. Compile and run each Java class to launch the corresponding application.
